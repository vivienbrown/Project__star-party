        Hang out and enjoy the night sky in a group setting. We will identify
        constellations, stars, asterisms, watch for meteors, observe the phases
        of the moon and learn from each other.

        <p>
          I am holding star parties each week, weather permitting. Join me in
          going out to the nature park and observing the sky!
        </p>
        <h3>The Rules</h3>
        <ul class="intro__rules">
          <li class="intro__rule">
            Please take good care of yourself. Bring your own snacks, water,
            thermos, etc
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            Take care of each other. If somebody shares a cup of hot tea, offer something in return if you can, but do not begrudge anyone who cannot share for any reason
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            Be responsible for your own things. If you bring equipment, please
            keep track of it, set it up and put it away. You are solely
            responsible for your own things.
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            Respect other people's things. If someone has set up a time lapse of
            the sky try not to get in front of it. If someone offers you a look
            through their binoculars or telescope, do not adjust their settings.
            If you are holding something small of someone elses or borrowed
            something during the night, when it comes time to return it please
            hand it back to them in their hand, do not leave it near them or
            with their things. Make it easy for others to keep track of their
            things.
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            Conversations are welcome, as is music, but please keep the volume
            down.
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            For night vision preservation, please keep lights to a minimum. Be
            mindful of flashlights, phone screens, vehicle headlights and
            taillights can all interfere with night vision and it can take 20
            minutes to an hour to restore.
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            Please respect your surroundings and other people by cleaning up
            after yourself. Before leaving, do a quick scan of the area you
            occupied and make sure you haven't forgotten anything or left any
            trash.
          </li>

          <li class="intro__rule">
            Wherever possible, give as much as you take.

        <h2 class="subheading">What time?</h2>
        <p>
          We will be meeting at 8pm through the summer months and hanging out
          until 10:30pm. The park closes at 11 so this will allow us time to
          pack up and clean up.
